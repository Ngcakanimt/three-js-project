# three-js-project

Simply put, a react application that allows you to customize a 3D shirt model with
  - A colour picker
  - Image Upload
  - AI Prompt to generate logos and shirt textures

There are bugs in the AI prompt. 

Plans to extend the project:
  - Add more 3D clothing models like a hoodie
  - Customizing the back of the model

This project is just for learning purposes and fun and was inspired by "JS Mastery"
